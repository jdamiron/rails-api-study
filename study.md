# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and answer
the following questions (no prior knowledge is expected).

In your answers, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write answers in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not answer with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   For now, we'll use the `rails-api` gem to create rails applications.
    `rails-api` is set to become part of Rails 5. We will never type `rails
    new`, instead preferring `rails-api new`.

## Define Model Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
Models talk to the database, they are classes. They contain the business logic.
```

## Define Controller Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The controllers recieve requests for the application. This is where information is collected.
```

## Define Router Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The router decides which requests are sent to which specific controller.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
The browser makes a request, then the web server recieves that request. Routes are used to select the controllor to use. The dispatcher then creates a new controller.  The controller parses the requests. The controller returns the response body to the server. The server then combines the data into a HTTP response and sends it back to the user.
```
